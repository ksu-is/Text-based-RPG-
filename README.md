# Text-based-RPG-
This is a text-based-rpg game made in python. 
You type different commands to navigate a 4x4 map and solve different puzzles in order to complete the game. 
This is created from code and a tutorial series made by Bryan Tong. 
His tutorial video series is linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFW8DJ6qsak&list=PL1-slM0ZOosXf2oQYZpTRAoeuo0TPiGpm&index=1
His completed project (different finished result than the tutorial, but similar concept and code I used as a reference) is linked here and copied into the KSU-IS github: https://github.com/ksu-is/python-text-rpg
Have fun!
